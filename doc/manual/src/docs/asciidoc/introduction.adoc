== Introduction

The MiniProfiler is a lightweight way to get runtime profiling information about significant parts of your codebase. It's useful to give a deep dive into a single processing unit - typically a single HTTP request for web-based applications - rather than overall metrics that a typical profiler might give.

Typical usage includes showing timing information for database queries, transactional service calls, and other high-level operations in a request.

The original MiniProfiler was written for the Microsoft CLR by the StackOverflow team and the motivations were described in a blog post by Jeff Atwood. Since then the MiniProfiler project has split into the Javascript-based UI component and a number of backends for different platforms. This project is the JVM backend, and it bundles the latest version of the "official" UI code.

Some effort has been made to follow conventions from the original CLR project around object and method names where possible.
